    Mechanic: Cartridges
  </h4>
  <p>Gunbreaker's are FFXIV's very own DPS tank. They are a more advanced tank focused on DPS and optimization of cartridges and rotations.<br>
    Instead of having high physical armor or magic defense they in turn have a more intensive rotation as well as higher damage output.
