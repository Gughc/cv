  <h2>Lost Saga</h2>
  <p>Originally I was a <strong>Grim Reaper </strong> main which then transitioned into a <strong>Mai Shiranui</strong>, I was most known for my <strong>Fire Mage </strong> however as I would drop their HP with 1 skill.
    <br>I was one of the original founders of the <a href="https://cdn2.nextinpact.com/images/bd/avatar/111280.png?v=627667488000000000">Wolf-Pack</a> Guild. We didn't have a hard press FP limit however instead based people of skill.

  <p>Smitten with a love for brawling I started out as a Monk. I wanted to feel the thrill of directional crits, Unfortunately, I played Monk when they were outdated.
    <br>This led to my eventual pick up of Dark Knight. I picked them up late one night during a series of harsh queue times for my MSQ, Even with a healer it was near impossible.
    <br>I began learning Dark Knight, tankxiety was a thing of the past once i did my first big pull. I was in control at last. Before I knew it as well it crept in on me.
    <br>The new comers to <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/freecompany/9231394073691033008/">Black Shield</a>. I've been there for quite some time, almost from the beginning or so it feels like. I kept to myself but they grew on me,
    I was blindsided.
    <br>The first friend I've made close was this young man, Grippo Vistache, however as days grew I saw him less frequent. Then suddenly he just up and disappeared. He remained, always offline.
    <br>That was that, until Blank Coatez made his way. As charismatic as he was he entered and we bounced off eachother's tempo. That was it, the second Brutha. Bruthahood had now been formed.
